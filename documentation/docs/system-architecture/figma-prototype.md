# Figma Prototype
[Figma Prototype](https://www.figma.com/design/dRrwQRsEXqcA9jeGNfToJM/AAC-Go-Fish-Prototype?node-id=0-1&t=EJZz9HW8ZuNciFbV-1)

The Figma prototype linked above contains a mockup/wireframe of the AAC cooking game menu. The prototype shows a walkthrough of each mode (manager and employee), and how they interact with each other to complete the game actions. Managers can relay a customerâ€™s order to the employees using the AAC board, and employees can complete the order and pass it back to the manager to deliver to the customer.
